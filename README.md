# calcolors
Based in Year in Pixels, I tried to recreate it version CLI terminal based. It work, but sadly with a awful lag, because the way for printing the days is based in a loop that read a file and then print in the terminal. This was just a test, made me learn a lot of bash, sed, awk, etc, I know the code is not ok and it can be better, I just dont have enough skills to do it yet, feel free to help.

## How to?
just run with: `bash calcolors6.1`
